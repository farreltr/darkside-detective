/*
This folder contains integration support files for Icebox Studio's Adventure Creator.

When you imported the Adventure Creator Support package, it also imported these files
into AdventureCreator/Scripts/Actions:

    ActionDialogueSystemBark.cs
    ActionDialogueSystemConversation.cs
    ActionDialogueSystemLua.cs
    ActionDialogueSystemRestoreData.cs
    ActionDialogueSystemSaveData.cs
        
Adventure Creator requires that these files are in its Actions folder. If you have
moved Adventure Creator from its default installation location, you *must* move
these files into the new location, too.

To make the new actions available in Adventure Creator, you must open the Game Editor
(Adventure Creator > Editors > Game Editor) and, on the Actions tab, click Refresh list.
